## Usage

### Managing the Server

Control and configure the server using the `jarvis-manager` command:

```bash
# Start the server
sudo jarvis-manager start

# Stop the server
sudo jarvis-manager stop

# Restart the server
sudo jarvis-manager restart

# Check server status
sudo jarvis-manager status

# Change the server port to 9090
sudo jarvis-manager port 9090

# Open an additional port in the firewall
sudo jarvis-manager open 8081

# List all open ports
sudo jarvis-manager ports

# Change log file location
sudo jarvis-manager log-path /path/to/new/logfile.log

# View the last 50 lines of logs
sudo jarvis-manager logs

# View the last 100 lines of logs
sudo jarvis-manager logs 100
```

### Sending Requests to the Server

You can send data to the server using curl or any HTTP client:

```bash
# Test with a simple GET request
curl http://localhost:8080

# Send JSON data with a POST request
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"test", "value":123, "message":"Hello Jarvis!"}' \
  http://localhost:8080
```

### View Logs

Check the logs to see incoming requests:

```bash
# Using the manager script
sudo jarvis-manager logs

# Direct log access
sudo tail -f /var/log/jarvis-ears.log

# Using journalctl (system logs)
sudo journalctl -u jarvis-ears -f
```

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

Default configuration is stored in `/opt/jarvis-ears/config.json`:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "log_path": "/var/log/jarvis-ears.log"
}
```

You can modify this file directly or use the `jarvis-manager` script to make changes.

### Service Configuration

The systemd service file is located at `/etc/systemd/system/jarvis-ears.service`. If you need to make advanced changes, edit this file and then reload the systemd configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart jarvis-ears
```
## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

Check the service status and logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jarvis-ears
sudo journalctl -u jarvis-ears
```

Common issues:
- Port already in use
- Permission problems with log file
- Python dependencies missing

### Can't Connect to Server

Verify:
1. Server is running: `sudo jarvis-manager status`
2. Correct port is open: `sudo jarvis-manager ports`
3. Firewall allows connections: `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all` or `sudo ufw status`
